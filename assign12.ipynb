      "source": "#An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional condition arises, an exception is raised, and if it is not handled properly, it can cause the program to terminate.\n#Exceptions are typically caused by errors in the program's logic, external factors like user input, or exceptional conditions such as a file not found. Examples of common exceptions in Python include `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `ZeroDivisionError`.\n#Syntax errors, on the other hand, are different from exceptions. They occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the language's rules regarding syntax. These errors indicate that the program's code is not written correctly and cannot be parsed by the interpreter. Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, invalid indentation, or incorrect usage of keywords.\n#Differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n#1. **Cause**: Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when a specific condition is met or an error is encountered. Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur before the program begins execution when the code is being parsed and checked for syntax correctness.\n#2. **Detection**: Exceptions are detected at runtime when the program is executing. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program starts running.\n#3. **Handling**: Exceptions can be caught and handled using `try` and `except` blocks. By handling exceptions, you can gracefully deal with errors and prevent the program from crashing. Syntax errors, however, need to be fixed in the code itself. They require correcting the syntax violation for the code to run successfully.\n#4. **Impact**: Exceptions can be raised and caught at different points in the program, allowing for localized error handling. They provide a mechanism to recover from exceptional situations and continue program execution. Syntax errors prevent the program from running altogether until they are fixed, as the interpreter cannot understand the code.",
