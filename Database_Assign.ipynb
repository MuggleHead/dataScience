It serves as a unique identifier for each row, ensuring data integrity and providing a means to establish relationships between tables. The primary key constraint ensures that the values in the primary key column(s) are unique and not null. Every table should have a primary key defined.\n#Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique, ensuring that no two records in the table have the same key value.\n#Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot contain null values. Each record must have a valid primary key value.\n#Immutable: The primary key values should not change over time. If needed, it is better to create a new record rather than modify the primary key value.\n\n#Foreign Key:\n#A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, known as the parent table (the one with the primary key) and the child table (the one with the foreign key). The foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity, enforcing that values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to existing values in the referenced primary key column(s).\n#Referential Integrity: The foreign key ensures that the values in the child table's foreign key column(s) match the values in the parent table's primary key column(s).\n#Relationship Establishment: A foreign key establishes relationships between tables, allowing you to connect related data across multiple tables.\n#Cascading Actions: You can define cascading actions on foreign keys, specifying what should happen when a referenced primary key value is modified or deleted. Actions like CASCADE, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT, or NO ACTION can be defined to maintain data consistency.",
